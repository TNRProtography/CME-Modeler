    'forecast': `This is a proprietary TNR Protography forecast that combines live solar wind data with local conditions like lunar phase and astronomical darkness. It is highly accurate for the next 2 hours. Remember, patience is key and always look south! <br><br><strong>What the Percentage Means:</strong><ul><li><strong>< 10% üòû:</strong> Little to no auroral activity.</li><li><strong>10-25% üòê:</strong> Minimal activity; cameras may detect a faint glow.</li></li><li><strong>25-40% üòä:</strong> Clear activity on camera; a faint naked-eye glow is possible.</li><li><strong>40-50% üôÇ:</strong> Faint naked-eye aurora likely, maybe with color.</li><li><strong>50-80% üòÄ:</strong> Good chance of naked-eye color and structure.</li><li><strong>80%+ ü§©:</strong> High probability of a significant substorm.</li></ul>`,
    'power': `<strong>What it is:</strong> The total energy being deposited by the solar wind into an entire hemisphere (North or South), measured in Gigawatts (GW).<br><br><strong>Effect on Aurora:</strong> Think of this as the aurora's overall brightness level. Higher power means more energy is available for a brighter and more widespread display.`,
    'speed': `<strong>What it is:</strong> The speed of the charged particles flowing from the Sun, measured in kilometers per second (km/s).<br><br><strong>Effect on Aurora:</strong> Faster particles hit Earth's magnetic field with more energy, leading to more dynamic and vibrant auroras with faster-moving structures.`,
    'density': `<strong>What it is:</strong> The number of particles within a cubic centimeter of the solar wind, measured in protons per cm¬≥. Higher density means more particles are available to collide with our atmosphere, resulting in more widespread and "thick" looking auroral displays.`,
    'bt': `<strong>What it is:</strong> The total strength of the Interplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF), measured in nanoteslas (nT).<br><br><strong>Effect on Aurora:</strong> A high Bt value indicates a strong magnetic field. While not a guarantee on its own, a strong field can carry more energy and lead to powerful events if the Bz is also favorable.`,
    'bz': `<strong>What it is:</strong> The North-South direction of the‰πéInterplanetary Magnetic Field (IMF), measured in nanoteslas (nT). This is the most critical component.<br><br><strong>Effect on Aurora:</strong> When Bz is strongly <strong>negative (south)</strong>, it opens a gateway for solar wind energy to pour in. A positive Bz closes this gate. <strong>The more negative, the better!</strong>`,
    'epam': `<strong>What it is:</strong> The Electron, Proton, and Alpha Monitor (EPAM) on the ACE spacecraft measures energetic particles from the sun.<br><br><strong>Effect on Aurora:</strong> This is not a direct aurora indicator. However, a sharp, sudden, and simultaneous rise across all energy levels can be a key indicator of an approaching CME shock front, which often precedes major auroral storms.`,
    'moon': `<strong>What it is:</strong> The percentage of the moon that is illuminated by the Sun.<br><br><strong>Effect on Aurora:</strong> A bright moon (high illumination) acts like natural light pollution, washing out fainter auroral displays. A low illumination (New Moon) provides the darkest skies, making it much easier to see the aurora.`,
    'ips': `<strong>What it is:</strong> An Interplanetary Shock (IPS) is the boundary of a disturbance, like a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME), moving through the solar system. The arrival of a shock front at Earth is detected by satellites like DSCOVR or ACE.<br><br><strong>Effect on Aurora:</strong> The arrival of an IPS can cause a sudden and dramatic shift in solar wind parameters (speed, density, and magnetic field). This can trigger intense auroral displays shortly after impact. This table shows the most recent shock events detected by NASA.`,

This causes a slow, steady <strong>drop</strong> in the Hp value over 1-2 hours.</li><li><strong class="text-green-400">Substorm Eruption:</strong> When the field snaps back, it causes a sharp, sudden <strong>jump</strong> in the Hp value (called a "dipolarization").
